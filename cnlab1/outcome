learnt and understood  the functionalities of hub and switches.
We came across PDU which is a single unit of data transmitted across the peers.
I understood the dataflow among end devices which are in the same network.
and also understood that hub isnt a intelligent device it just broadcasts the data across all the available devices but switch doesnt do so.
